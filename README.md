# SQL Challenge
In this SQL Challenge, I created 2 tables in my 'Personal Database' and practised with different T-SQL statements. I explored the following:
Creating Tables
Inserting Data into Tables
Updating Tables
Deleting Tables
Aggregate Functions
Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
TEMP Tables
Stored Procedures
STRINGS AND TRIMS
